# ✨ Add Percentage Calculation Utility

## 📄 Description
We need a utility function to calculate percentages within the PowerBI JavaScript library. This utility will streamline scenarios where percentage calculations are needed, such as:
- 📊 Rendering percentage-based visualizations.
- ⏳ Displaying progress indicators.
- 📈 Calculating relative metrics for data processing.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Add a function to calculate percentages based on a `part` and a `total`.
- Ensure the function:
  - Returns `0` if the `total` is `0`. 🛑
  - Handles edge cases gracefully. ✅
- Place the function in the appropriate utilities or helper file. 📂

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- 🖋️ A fully implemented `calculatePercentage` utility function.
- 🧪 Comprehensive unit tests validating its functionality written in Jest.
- 📝 Clear and concise documentation accompanying the function.

## 💡 Rationale
This utility will:
- 🧹 Improve code reusability and readability.
- 🚀 Reduce redundancy in calculating percentages across the codebase.
- 🛡️ Ensure consistent implementation of percentage logic.

## 🔥 Priority
**Medium**

## 🔍 Additional Notes
- Ensure the function adheres to existing code style and patterns within the repository. 🎨
- Maintain clarity and simplicity to support future enhancements. 📈
